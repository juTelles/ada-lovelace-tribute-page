                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1815</strong> - London, England, on december tenth of 1815, Augusta Ada Byron was born,
                        daughter of George Gordon Byron, 6th, or simply Lord Byron, an English Poet with an unbecoming
                        reputation and a bad temper, and Anne Isabella Noel Byron, Lady Byron, an English mathematician,
                        who was also a very religious and rigid woman.</li>
                    <li><strong>1816</strong> - In january of 1816, the couple’s finances had become a matter of concern
                        and Lord Byron’s bad temper had only got worse. As a temporary measure Lord Byron requested that
                        Lady Byron and Ada went to live with Lady Byron’s parents until he could put their finances in
                        order. What was supposed to be temporary became permanent, Lady Baron believed her husband was
                        mad and found out facts about him that her strong moral beliefs could not tolerate. In that same
                        year, by legal advice and with her parents' incentive she sent Lord Biron a letter asking for
                        legal separation, at the beginning he refused to accept, but at the threat of having some of his
                        immoral acts becoming public he at last accepted.</li>
                    <li><strong>1824</strong> - Lord Baron died, letting Lady Baron as the sole custodian of Ada, when
                        she was only eight years old. Lady Baron was herself a mathematician, considered to be very
                        intelligent since her childhood, she was given an education to the level of a cambridge scholar.
                        With her own love of exact sciences and the idea that living and breathing a rigid education
                        could prevent her daughter to develop her father's so called madness, Ada's several private
                        tutors were instructed to teach her mathematics and sciences from a very early age.</li>
                    <li><strong>1833</strong> - At seventeen, Ada had become very talented in mathematics and with the
                        help Mary Somerville, one of her tutors and also a very bright mind, Ada met Charles Babbage,
                        the so called "father of computers", only a month or so later Babbage presented Ada to his
                        machine, the "difference engine" and she was mesmerized by it.
                        1842 - Now an adult of substantial knowledge, Ada was asked to translate from french to english
                        a transcription, written by the italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea, of an lecture given by
                        Babbage in the university of Turin, in which he participated and transcribed Bannage's ideas
                        about his future new machine: the "Analytical Engine".</li>
                    <li><strong>1835</strong> - Ada Byron became Ada King, due to her marriege to William, 8th Baron,
                        the couple had 3 children together, in 1836 was born Byron, in 1837 Ada gave birth to her only
                        daughter, Anne Isabelle after her mather and in 1839 Ada gave birth to her youngster, Ralph
                        Gordon.</li>
                    <li><strong>1839</strong> - Ada was the sole descendent of the Barons of Lovelace, an important
                        title, and for this her husband was made the next Earl of Lovelace and Ada became, like most
                        know her, the Countess of Lovelace.</li>
                    <li><strong>1843</strong> - Ada's work was published in the September edition of Taylor's Scientific
                        Memoirs. Ada not only finished the job she was asked, she went way further than a simple
                        translation, she wrote her own take on the Analytical Engine. In a paper she called Notes, Ada
                        explained the machine, it's functionality and structure, and even described algorithms and how
                        they could be implemented in the analytical machine, descriptions that can be considered the
                        first program ever written. Furthermore, Ada had a different take on mathematics than most, at
                        her time, she believed in integrating poetry with science and she applied this concept in the
                        analytical engine machine, she wrote in her notes that the machine was capable of calculating
                        more than numbers, that it was possible to represent real life subjects and objects in numeral
                        form and with this manipulate those represented entities.</li>
                    <li><strong>1852</strong> - After her work with Babbage, Ada never stopped studying and working on
                        other projects, unfortunately with only 36 years old she developed uterine cancer, and in an age
                        where our medicine was still very much rudimentar, after several months of great disability and
                        pain she died, but her great work and ideas survived through the years in scientific papers, in
                        several novels of all kinds and celebrations of her place in the history of programming.</li>
                    <li><strong>1980</strong> - Ada, a computer language made for the United States Department of
                        Defense, was named after her.</li>
                    <li><strong>1981</strong> - The Ada Lovelace Award was created by the Association for Women in
                        Computing.
                        2009 - She won her own day on the second tuesday of October.</li>
                    <li><strong>2015</strong> - Her illustration won a place in all new British passports.</li>
                    <li><strong>2017</strong> - Google made a google doodle in her honor.</li>
                    <li><strong>2018</strong> - The ninth of October became the National Ada Lovelace Day in the whole
                        United States of America.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conclusion</strong> - Over all these years there are several more tributes to Ada,
                        colleges named after her, days on her behalf, prizes in her honor, all made to honor her
                        contributions to science. But history also holds some controversies about Ada’s contributions:
                        some say Ada’s programs, presented on her notes, were actually made by Babbage years before and
                        only published by her, others that she her notes made no real advance only described what
                        Babbage had already found, some even say she wasn’t bright at all. But all, even hers most avide
                        critics, can’t refute two very important facts:
                        Ada was the first to publish a program specifically made to be implemented on a machine and that
                        Ada, with her concept of integrating math and poet, or better yet, math and real life, was the
                        first to see the potential of going beyond the numbers, she theorized that the analytical engine
                        could not only calculate numbers but also abstract objects, who could be adapted to be
                        represented by numbers, and there for, manipulate and calculated. Her concept of math and real
                        life is nothing more than today’s modern concept of math itself and her theory of computing
                        entities is an anticipation of the concept of modern computing or general-purpose computation.
                        Who knows? But, if you ask for my opinion, I would certainly classify such a woman, with a mind
                        years ahead of her time, a brilliant genius, and completely deserving of the title of first
                        computer programming.</li>
                    <li>If you have found any errors, of any kind, taking in consideration this is only a brief of Ada’s
                        life and work, please let me know!!!</li>
